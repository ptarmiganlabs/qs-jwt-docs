# Security and Disclosure

qs-jwt is open source and you have access to all source code.  
It is **your own responsibility** to determine if qs-jwt is suitable for **your** use case.
The creators of qs-jwt, including Ptarmigan Labs, GÃ¶ran Sander or any other contributor, can and must never be held liable to past or future security issues of qs-jwt.
If you have security concerns or ideas around qs-jwt, please get involved in the project and contribute to making it better!

::: danger Security Disclosure
If you discover a serious bug with qs-jwt that may pose a security problem, please disclose it
confidentially to security@ptarmiganlabs.com first, so it can be assessed and hopefully fixed
prior to being exploited.

Please do not raise GitHub issues for serious security-related doubts or problems.

## Virus Scanning

Every time a qs-jwt release is done the created binaries are sent to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) for scanning.  
VirusTotal acts as an aggregated virus scanner that sends the qs-jwt binaries to dozens of anti-virus scanners, including many of the major, established ones.

Links to the VirusTotal scan report are included in each release notes, making it easy to check the status of each binary:

A VirusTotal scan that reports "no risks found" can look like this:

### Positive scan vs false positives

If one or more of the security vendors used by VirusTotal reports an issue you have to make a decision.  
Is it a real issue or a false positive?

You have to decide this yourself, but some general lines of thought can be:

> Is it a single vendor that reports the qs-jwt binary file to be a risk, or several vendors?
> If one vendor reports an issue and 60+ vendors don't, you might be looking at a false positive.

But again - at the end of the day it's **you** that must make that decision.

A scan where a single security vendor reports an issue can look like this:

## Signed Binaries

The macOS executable binary is signed and notarized by Apple's standard process.  
A warning may still be shown first time the app is started. This is expected and normal.

The Windows executable binary is signed by "Ptarmigan Labs AB".

## JWT Security Considerations

### JWT Data Exposure

::: warning Important
JWTs (when used with Qlik Sense) contain unencrypted information about users and provide access to the Qlik Sense system. In other words: **Qlik Sense JWTs should be treated just like user IDs and passwords.**
:::

Key security points about JWTs:

- **Not Encrypted**: JWT data can be read by anyone who intercepts the token
- **Cryptographically Signed**: Cannot be modified without detection
- **Time-Limited**: Use short expiration times as a security best practice
- **Revocation**: Once created, JWTs cannot be revoked until expiry

### Best Practices

#### JWT Handling
- **Use HTTPS**: Always transmit JWTs over encrypted connections
- **Short Expiration**: Keep JWT validity periods short (hours/days, not months)
- **Secure Storage**: Store JWTs securely, never in plain text files or logs
- **Minimal Claims**: Only include necessary information in JWT claims

#### Certificate Management
- **Protect Private Keys**: Never commit private keys to source control
- **Key Rotation**: Rotate signing certificates regularly
- **Key Storage**: Use secure key management systems in production
- **Access Control**: Limit who can access signing keys

#### Operational Security
- **Monitoring**: Monitor JWT usage and expiration
- **Logging**: Be careful about what JWT-related information is logged
- **Environment Separation**: Use different certificates for different environments
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of JWT policies and procedures

## Development Security

### Source Code
- All source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/qs-jwt)
- Code is regularly reviewed and updated
- Community contributions are welcome and reviewed
- Issues and security concerns can be reported through GitHub

### Dependencies
- qs-jwt uses well-established, maintained libraries
- Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- Dependency scanning is performed as part of the build process

### Build Process
- Builds are automated and reproducible
- Binary artifacts are scanned before release
- Release process includes security checks

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- JWTs may contain personal information (names, emails)
- Consider GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- Implement appropriate data handling procedures
- Document JWT data flows and retention policies

### Audit Requirements
- Log JWT creation and usage events
- Maintain records of certificate management
- Document security procedures and policies
- Regular security reviews and updates

### Industry Standards
- Follow JWT best practices (RFC 7519)
- Implement proper certificate management
- Use appropriate cryptographic standards
- Regular security assessments
