## About

A cross platform, command line tool for creating JWTs (=JSON Web Tokens) that can be used to authenticate with Qlik Sense.

qs-jwt nicely complements the more operationally focused open source tools in the [Butler family](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs). Those tools focus on things such as real-time monitoring of client-managed Qlik Sense environments, flexible and powerful alerts/notifications when reloads fail, automatically creating sheet thumbnails and much more.

## Open Source

qs-jwt is open source software released under the MIT License. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/qs-jwt).

qs-jwt is sponsored by Ptarmigan Labs, a Swedish consulting company specialising in advanced Qlik Sense development.
